# Single-Price-Grid-Component

## The challenge

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Deploying your projects

You can deploy your project for free on these platforms:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/): [How to deploy on Github Pages](https://youtu.be/BT4WzyT2g8k)

## Contributions and Collaboration

Also, this project aims to simplify and guide the way beginners make their contribution. If you are looking to make your first contributions, follow the steps below.

_If you're not comfortable with command line, [here are tutorials using GUI tools.](#tutorials-using-other-tools)_

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />

#### If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button, then on SSH tab and then click the _copy url to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```bash
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/copy-to-clipboard.png" alt="copy URL to clipboard" />

For example:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:this-is-you/first-contributions.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.

### Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```bash
cd first-contributions
```

Now create a branch using the `git switch` command:

```bash
git switch -c your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```bash
git switch -c add-alonzo-church
```

<details>
<summary> <strong>If you get any errors using git switch, click here:</strong> </summary>

If the error message "Git: `switch` is not a git command. See `git â€“help`" appears, it's likely because you're using an older version of git.

In this case, try to use `git checkout` instead:

```bash
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

</details>

### Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open `Contributors.md` file in a text editor, add your name to it and it should be it should be in this format:

```bash
## Contributors

- [Your Full Name](https://github.com/githubusername)
```

After that, save it

<img align="right" width="450" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/git-status.png" alt="git status" />

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```bash
git add Contributors.md
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```bash
git commit -m "Add your-name to Contributors list"
```

replacing `your-name` with your name.

### Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```bash
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

- #### Authentication Error
     <pre>remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. Please use a personal access token instead.
  remote: Please see https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/ for more information.
  fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/<your-username>/first-contributions.git/'</pre>
  Go to [GitHub's tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) on generating and configuring an SSH key to your account.

  Also, you might want to run 'git remote -v' to check your remote address.
  
  If it looks anything like this:
  <pre>origin	https://github.com/your-username/your_repo.git (fetch)
  origin	https://github.com/your-username/your_repo.git (push)</pre>
  
  change it using this command:
  ```bash
  git remote set-url origin git@github.com:your-username/your_repo.git
  ```
  Otherwise you'll still get prompted for username and password and get authentication error.
